# ML-Assignment
The aim of this assignment is to study and compare effectiveness of supervised dimensionality reduction techniques over unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques.  
Four dimensionality reduction techniques, 2 unsupervised(Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis) and 2 supervised(Fisher's Linear Discriminant and Neighbourhood Component Analysis) were chosen to be implemented in R. Their performance was evaluated by applying two classifiers(SVM and KNN) on the reduced datasets Three classification datasets
were utilised:-
1. Wine Dataset : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine
2. Ionosphere Dataset : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ionosphere
3. Connectionist Bench (Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks) : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks)

This project was carried out as part of the course BITS F464 Machine Learning under the supervision of Prof. Navneet Goyal.
