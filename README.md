# ML-Assignment
The main aim of this assignment is to study and compare various techniques of dimensionality reduction and their effects on classification applications.
Four dimensionality reduction techniques, 2 unsupervised(Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis) and 2 supervised(Fisher's Linear Discriminant and Neighbourhood Component Analysis) were chosen and implemented in R. Three classification datasets
were utilised:-
1. Wine Dataset : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine
2. Ionosphere Dataset : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ionosphere
3. Connectionist Bench (Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks) : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks)
This project was carried out as part of the course BITS F464 Machine Learning under the supervision of Prof. Navneet Goyal
